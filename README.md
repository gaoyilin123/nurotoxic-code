# nurotoxic-code
This project aims to develop a neurotoxicity prediction model based on molecular fingerprints and machine learning. Neurotoxicity refers to harmful changes in the structure and function of the nervous system caused by chemical, physical, or biological factors. The project incorporates various molecular fingerprints, such as MorganFP, MACCS, RDKFP, and TopologicalTorsionFP, combined with machine learning models including XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to build the neurotoxicity prediction model.
